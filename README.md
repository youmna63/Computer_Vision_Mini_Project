Tuberculosis (TB)

Tuberculosis (TB), infectious disease that is caused by the tubercle bacillus, Mycobacterium tuberculosis. In most forms of the disease, the bacillus spreads slowly and widely in the lungs, causing the formation of hard nodules (tubercles) or large cheese like masses that break down the respiratory tissues and form cavities in the lungs. Blood vessels also can be eroded by the advancing disease, causing the infected person to cough up bright red blood.
It can spread to other parts of your body, like your brain and spine.
Tuberculosis Types: There are two forms of the disease:
Latent TB:  You have the germs in your body, but your immune system stops them from spreading. That means you don’t have any symptoms and you’re not contagious.
Active TB:  This means the germs multiply and can make you sick. You can spread the disease to others. Ninety percent of adult cases of active TB are from the reactivation of a latent TB infection
Signs and symptoms:
Classic clinical features associated with active pulmonary TB are as follows (elderly individuals with TB may not display typical signs and symptoms):
•	Cough
•	Weight loss/anorexia
•	Fever
•	Night sweats
•	Hemoptysis
•	Chest pain (can also result from tuberculous acute pericarditis)
•	Fatigue
Symptoms of tuberculous meningitis may include the following:
•	Headache that has been either intermittent or persistent for 2-3 weeks
•	Subtle mental status changes that may progress to coma over a period of days to weeks
•	Low-grade or absent fever
Symptoms of skeletal TB may include the following:
•	Back pain or stiffness
•	Lower-extremity paralysis, in as many as half of patients with undiagnosed Pott disease
•	Tuberculous arthritis, usually involving only 1 joint (most often the hip or knee, followed by the ankle, elbow, wrist, and shoulder)
Symptoms of genitourinary TB may include the following:
•	Flank pain
•	Dysuria
•	Frequent urination
•	In men, a painful scrotal mass, prostatitis, orchitis, or epididymitis
•	In women, symptoms mimicking pelvic inflammatory disease
Symptoms of gastrointestinal TB are referable to the infected site and may include the following:
•	Nonhealing ulcers of the mouth or anus
•	Difficulty swallowing (with esophageal disease)
•	Abdominal pain mimicking peptic ulcer disease (with gastric or duodenal infection)
•	Malabsorption (with infection of the small intestine)
•	Pain, diarrhea, or hematochezia (with infection of the colon)
Physical examination findings associated with TB depend on the organs involved. Patients with pulmonary TB may have the following:
•	Abnormal breath sounds, especially over the upper lobes or involved areas
•	Rales or bronchial breath signs, indicating lung consolidation
Signs of extrapulmonary TB differ according to the tissues involved and may include the following:
•	Confusion
•	Coma
•	Neurologic deficit
•	Chorioretinitis
•	Lymphadenopathy
•	Cutaneous lesions
Medication And Doses:
The treatment of tuberculosis (TB) must satisfy the following basic therapeutic principles:
•	Any regimen must use multiple drugs to which Mycobacterium tuberculosis is susceptible
•	The medications must be taken regularly
•	The therapy must continue for a period sufficient to resolve the illness 
•	First line treatment of tuberculosis :
    2HRZE/4HR
	Intensive phase (2 months)

	Ethambutol (EMB/E) 15mg/kg/day
800-1600mg/day (40-55kg 800mg/day, 56-75kg 1200mg/day, 76-90kg 1600mg)      
	Pyrazinamide (PZA/Z) 25-30mg/kg/day
	1000-2000mg/day (40-55kg 1000mg/day, 56-75kg 1500mg/day, 76-90kg 2000mg)      
	Continuous phase (4 months)
	Isoniazid (INH/H) 5mg/kg/day      ;Max =300mg
	Rifampicin (RIF/R) 10mg/kg/day      ;Max =600mg
•	Second line treatment of tuberculosis :
	Cycloserine                      10-15mg/kg/day (500-1000mg in 2 divided doses)
	Ethionamide                    15-20,g/kg/day (1000mg in single or two divided          doses)
	Streptomycin                  1g daily or 15mg/kg/day  I/M or I/V
	Amikacin/ Kanamycin   1g daily or 15mg/kg/day  I/M or I/V
	Capreomycin                    1g daily or 15mg/kg/day  I/M or I/V
	P-amino salicylic acid      8-12g/day in 2-3 divided doses
	Levofloxacin                     500mg Q12H
	Moxifloxacin                    400mg/day
	Linezolid                           600mg Q12H (in case of extensive drug resistant)
	Bedaquiline                     4000mg PO Q24H for 2 weeks, than 200mg PO 3 times/week for 22 weeks. 
First line drugs are more effective and less toxic and vice versa for second line drugs.
•	Multidrug Resistant Tuberculosis:
It is a type of TB in which microbe is resistant to isoniazid and rifampicin. Then first line drugs are used with second line drugs which includes an aminoglycoside (e.g. Streptomycin, Amikacin, Kanamycin or Capreomycin), a fluoroquinolone (levofloxacin, moxifloxacin) and one or more of following: cycloserine, ethionamide or P-amionosalicylic acid. Duration of treatment is 18 months.

Class Summary :
Antitubercular agents:
The goals of TB treatment are to shorten the clinical course of TB, prevent complications, prevent the development of latency and/or subsequent recurrences, and decrease the likelihood of TB transmission. In patients with latent TB, the goal of therapy is to prevent disease progression.
	Isoniazid:
This is the drug of choice for use in preventive therapy and the primary drug for use in combination therapy for active TB. It is also used in combination with rifapentine for adults and children aged 2 years or older with latent TB as once-weekly DOT therapy for 12 weeks. Its mechanism of action is not fully known, but isoniazid may inhibit the synthesis of mycolic acid, resulting in disruption of the bacterial cell wall. In patients receiving treatment for active TB, pyridoxine 25-50 mg orally once daily should be co-administered to prevent peripheral neuropathy.
	Rifampin (Rifadin):
Rifampin is used in combination with at least 1 other antituberculosis drug for the treatment of active TB. It inhibits DNA-dependent RNA polymerase activity in bacterial cells but not in mammalian cells. Cross-resistance may occur.
In most susceptible cases, the patient undergoes 6 months of treatment. Treatment lasts for 9 months if the patient's sputum culture result is still positive after 2 months of therapy. 
	Pyrazinamide:
This is a pyrazine analog of nicotinamide that is either bacteriostatic or bactericidal against M tuberculosis, depending on the concentration of drug attained at the site of infection. Pyrazinamide's mechanism of action is unknown. Administer the drug for the initial 2 months of a 6-month or longer treatment regimen for drug-susceptible TB. Treat drug-resistant TB with individualized regimens.
	Ethambutol (Myambutol):
Ethambutol diffuses into actively growing mycobacterial cells (eg, tubercle bacilli). It impairs cell metabolism by inhibiting the synthesis of 1 or more metabolites, which in turn causes cell death. No cross-resistance has been demonstrated.
Mycobacterial resistance is frequent with previous therapy. In such cases, use ethambutol in combination with second-line drugs that have not been previously administered. Administer every 24 hours until permanent bacteriologic conversion and maximal clinical improvement are observed. Absorption is not significantly altered by food.
Adverse effects of ethambutol include optic neuritis, which is usually reversible with discontinuation of the drug. During the period when the patient is on a daily dose of 25 mg/kg, monthly eye exams are recommended.
